# Analyse data

Run the script `extract_info_from_logs.py`. It will extract the average QPS and the minimum, maximum, and average latency for P95 from the files present in the folder `part1_raw_outputs`. The extracted data will be placed in the folder `part1_extracted_data`, where there is a Python script called `create_plot.py` that will plot the data.
